# Convex-Hull-Algorithms
DSA Implementations of Convex-Hull Algorithms in 2D-coordinate space.

The following contains 2 different types of implementations :-
1. #### **Andrew's Algorithm for calculating the 2D-Convex Hull in O(n log n) time**. Displaying the step-by-step insertion and deletion procedure for the same using pygame module. - `PYTHON3`
2. #### Using Doxygen to document the implementations of the following 3 algorithms - `C++`
a) **Jarvis March Algorithm** - O(n. h) time where h is no. of final output points on the Hull.
b) **QuickHull Algorithm** - O(n log n) time where n is the no. of input points.
c) **Graham-Scan Algorithm** - O(n log n) time where n is no. of input points.
